### Hi！👋
I'm in my final year of Front-end development studies at Nackademin.🏫. I'm passionate about popular frameworks like React.js and Vue.js, and preparing to become a full-stack developer in the future. 🧐.  

  
Start with a quiz program to get to know me!😄   https://chen44a.github.io/Quiz-Projektarbete/  
Try my Pokémon application to escape the boredom. 😜  https://chen44a.github.io/Pokemon-Application/index.html
